# Mini-Project

In our project, we created a website that mimics the Lee Office printing page. The website will offer a 50% discount for printing for students who are reserved duties.
After the user places his order we will ask him to download a receipt containing malware.
The malware changes the names of all the files in the folder to which the malware was downloaded, replaces all the text files ('.doc', '.txt', '.docx') content with a ‘Hacked’ message, replaces all the images ('.jpg', '.jpeg', '.png', '.gif', '.bmp') of the Lee Office logo, then it goes to the parent folder and deletes all the other folders and files in this level.
